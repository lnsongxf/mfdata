# mfdata: Database for macro-finance research

`mfdata` is a Python package designed for economic researchers to conveniently collect and navigate in macroeconomic and financial datasets. The package enables easy access to [FRED](http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/) through `fredapi` and can parse the Federal Resere Board H.8 table into a well-formatted database. Users have to obtain their own FRED api key and WRDS account in order to properly use this package. The project is ongoing and please come back for updates!
